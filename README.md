CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and the Saga design pattern are architectural patterns that can be used to design 
and implement scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled systems. Let's delve into each of these patterns:

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):

    Concept:
        CQRS is a design pattern that suggests separating the responsibility for handling commands (write operations that change the
        system's state) from queries (read operations that retrieve data without changing the system's state).
        It introduces the idea of having separate models for reading and writing.
    Implementation:
        You can define separate models for read and write operations.
        Use different databases or data storage mechanisms optimized for reads and writes.
        Spring Boot's @Service and @Repository annotations can be used to define services and repositories specific to each model.

What is SAGA?
The Saga architecture pattern provides transaction management using a sequence of local transactions. A local transaction is the
unit of work performed by a saga participant. Every operation that is part of the Saga can be rolled back by a compensating transaction. 
Further, the Saga pattern guarantees that either all operations are complete successfully or the corresponding compensation transactions are 
run to undo the work previously completed.

The SAGA Design Pattern is also a way to manage data consistency across microservices in distributed transaction scenarios.

    Concept:
        A saga is a long-lived transaction that consists of a series of sub-transactions or steps. Each step in the saga represents a 
        distinct operation that contributes to the overall business transaction.
        It is often used in distributed systems to manage transactions that span multiple services.
    Implementation:
        Use Spring Boot's messaging or event-driven capabilities to implement sagas.
        Define a saga orchestrator that coordinates the sequence of steps in the saga.
        Each step of the saga can be implemented as a separate microservice or a component.
        Use messaging systems like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ to facilitate communication between saga steps.
        Implement compensating transactions to handle rollback in case of a failure.
